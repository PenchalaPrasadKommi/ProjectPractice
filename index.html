One of the best Masjid named Mecca Masjid is located in Hyderabad. And in front of Mecca Masjid, there are so many shops of things Islamic people use in their day-to-day lives. 
                And also have other some spots like Golconda fort, Charminar. You have to go there once.</div>

              <div class="desc-review">Hyderabad is a place where we can visit so many tourist and famous places. One of my favorite places is Charminar in Hyderabad. Charminar is very famous in India. When I visited Charminar, it feels fascinating. I bought a ticket to climb Charminar. It's a bit hot due to summer.
                Hotels are available there. Star hotels and more. I also ate Hyderabad biriyani in paradise biriyani .very tasty biriyani so spicy, but the taste was delicious. Birla mandir is a good place to visit in Hyderabad. When I went to Birla mandir its very silent, and feel peaceful. We also can see Hussain Sagar from Birla mandir temple. Ramoji film city is very famous in Hyderabad, and I enjoyed it a lot by visiting there. Finally, I'm delighted to visit Hyderabad.</div>

              <div class="desc-review">I visited here many times because I love this place very much. Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state. We can reach here very easily through Rajive Gandhi international airport, Train and Bus. 
                Many beautiful places are there. We have to visit Charminar, Golkonda, Ramoja Film city and Salar Jung museum. For accommodation, both 3 star and 5-star hotels are there with good accommodation and food. Rent will be based on the standards of hotels. Hyderabadi Dum biriyani is a very famous and tasty food. Totally this is the place where you get tasty food. This is a very crowded place, so we have to take care of ourselves. Totally this is a very beautiful place to visit.</div>

               <div class="desc-review">Hello everyone, today I want to share my tour with you that I had in last week to Hyderabad. I had a great experience. This is a small city situated in Telangana Andhra Pradesh. There are many fabulous things to do in Hyderabad. One of the best things I experienced was the Snow World in Hyderabad. The Snow world's entry fee is 500 rupees, but it is worth it as it is giving us an awesome experience. The next famous all-time favorite thing of Hyderabad is the Hyderabadi biryani. The one and only one of the famous Paradise hotel for biryani. 
                Hyderabad is also known as the city of pearls. And also is important for its great historical significance. One of the best historical significance of Hyderabad is the Charminar. Charminar is situated in the middle of the city in the busy market. The next important historical significance is Golconda Fort. It was the best historical place that I have seen as the architectural building and construction of the Fort is mind-blowing; even the decorations and architectures of that time are still there. So this was a great experience for me to be in Hyderabad and I would suggest you can have a trip to Hyderabad and enjoy thank you.</div>
